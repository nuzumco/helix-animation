# Helix Animation
Graphic experiments with Helix animations for Hubble

#### Concept

Helix is the Orbs consensus algorithm. Unlike traditional blockchains, every time a block is closed in Orbs, two blocks are actually added - the Transactions block and the Results block (this is part of our scalable architecture).

This is the origin of the name Helix, instead of a one dimentional chain of blocks, we have two chains of blocks that are growing in parallel - resembling the double helix strands of DNA.
